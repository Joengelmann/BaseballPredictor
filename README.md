This program is a simple machine learning project with the goal of predicting the result of an at-bat in baseball from various statistics. First I load and clean the data, and then created a correlation matrix to visualize the variable relationships. Next I created a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, decision tree, random forest, and three support vector machines. I computed training and testing accuracy, and a confusion matrix for each model. The results showed that the random forest was best at prediciting the outcome of each at-bat.

Make sure you have pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn installed in your environment. Also note that I found the data online. Thanks for trying my code!
